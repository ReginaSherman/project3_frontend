# project3_frontend

## Description
-This app is designed to allow users to sign-up for an account and then browse random podcasts from Spotify's database, and also search Spotify's database by podcast title in order to find information about and listen to podcasts. The users can also save podcasts to their own "playlist" in order to organize/keep track of their favorite podcasts.

## List of Features / User Stories
-this comes from the OG proposal

## List of Technologies Used
-MERN (mongoose, express, React, and node) were all used in this project to allow for CRUD functionality within the app.
-Specifically, we created a mongo database which allowed us to POST user specific data (from the React front-end) and then GET that data in the React front-end as well.
